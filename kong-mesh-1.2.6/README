Kong Mesh is built on top of CNCF's Kuma and Envoy, and it extends them with
additional enterprise features.

To get started with Kong Mesh you can take a look at the official documentation:

* Documentation: https://docs.konghq.com/mesh

GETTING STARTED:

To get started and read the quickstart, follow the instructions for your 
distribution at: https://konghq.com/install/

While we support different installation methods for both Kubernetes, VMs and 
other containerized environments, you can also follow these simple commands to 
get up and running quickly:

KUBERNETES (Standalone):

If you are installing Kong Mesh on Kubernetes, run the following command:

$ kumactl install control-plane --license-path=license.json | kubectl apply -f -

UNIVERSAL (Standalone):

If you are installing Kong Mesh on other platforms (including VMs or other
containerized environments), just run:

$ KMESH_LICENSE_PATH=license.json kuma-cp run

In Universal mode Kong Mesh runs with the in-memory backend by default. 
To use Postgres instead please read the docs:
